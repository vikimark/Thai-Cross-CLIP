## Overview

This model is a Thai text encoder which is a part of CLIP. This model is trained via Teacher Learning method using OpenAi's CLIP as Teacher

This repo contain only Text encoder which is compatible with ViT-B/32 OpenAi's Image encoder. To use this model as CLIP, you need to clone this repo (text encoder) and OpenAi's CLIP (image encoder). Look furthermore in Tutorial notebook [TBA]
